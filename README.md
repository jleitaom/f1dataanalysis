# Interactive Formula 1 Data Analysis Tool

### Description:

- Web application for analyzing Formula 1 data, coded in Python using Streamlit and FastF1 API.

- The purpose of this tool is to explore session data, driver telemetry, tire performance and strategies across various Grand Prix events. It provides an intuitiveand interactive interface, making the data accessible to enthusiasts and analysts alike.

- **Streamlit App**: https://f1dataanalysisapp.streamlit.app/

### 1. Features:

- **Session Results**: Summary table with race results, qualifying times and driver performance metrics.

- **Fastest Lap Telemetry**: Visual comparison of telemetry data (speed, throttle, brake) for drivers’ fastest laps.

- **Tire & Lap Time Performance**: Scatter plots showing tire compound performance over laps for selected drivers.

- **Tire Strategy Visualization**: Bar charts displaying drivers’ stint lengths and compounds used.

### 2. User Experience
**Ease of Use**:
-  Simple sidebar for selecting year, race, and session type.
- Tabs to separate different visualizations.
